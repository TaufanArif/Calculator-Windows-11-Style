Calculator Windows 11 Style for Windows 7 / 8
This is only prototipe. Some button (like X^2,^2/X, 1/x, M+ ,etc) are not working.
only runs for a few operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, and, division.
the "%" button is still in experimentation
Note: I'm still learning C#. If there are some properties that are wrong, please understand :)
